    <h1 ><strong>little about myself</strong></h1><br>
     
    <p><img src="logo6.jpg" alt="my myself" width="345" height="345">I am Michael, a citizen of Guyana, currently employed with the Defence Force of Guyana. I decided to start this website as an inspirational guide that I trust will serve me with the cultivation of my thoughts, also one of which I am hoping for, will also serve as an inspiration and encouragement for many others. A profound meaning in life for me, is one that involves the exchange of thoughts, I believe only then can one be assured of the opportunity of expanding emotionally, spiritually, mentally and intellectually. Itâ€™s with this thought that caused me to become inspired and aroused by my deep passionate desire for sharing and exchanging my thoughts and views on many topics in life with others. I am sincerely welcoming all who finds my website interesting and meaningful and I am prepared and ready to accept all forms of criticism, whether constructive or destructive, this for me is all part of the beauty in the expansion process of oneself, therefor I am looking forward for your thoughts on that which I have shared with you. As such I wish to thank you for your response in advance.</p>
